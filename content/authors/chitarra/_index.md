Olivia Chitarra is a PhD student at Institut des Sciences Moléculaires d'Orsay (ISMO) under the direction of Olivier Pirali and Marie-Aline Martin-Drumel. She performed her Master internship at ISMO and then began her PhD in 2019. During her Master degree, she investigated at high resolution several stable molecules: cyanoadamantane and isocyanoadamantane, and 1,2-dicyanobenzene and 1,3-dicyanobenzene. Olivia's PhD subject is focused on the study of radicals in the (sub)millimeter-wave spectral region. To date, the study of 3 radicals was performed up to 900 GHz: the methoxy (CH<sub>3</sub>O), hydroxymethyl (CH<sub>2</sub>OH), and cyanomethyl (CH<sub>2</sub>CN) radicals. The team now aims at developing a supersonic expansion ([SPECIES project]({{< relref "/project/species" >}})) to allow for the study of new radicals.
