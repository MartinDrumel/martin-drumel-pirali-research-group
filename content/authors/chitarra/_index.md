Olivia Chitarra is a PhD student at Institut des Sciences Moléculaires d'Orsay (ISMO) under the direction of Olivier Pirali and Marie-Aline Martin. She did master internship at ISMO and then began her PhD in 2019. After the high resolution study of several stable molecules: Cyanoadamantane and Isocyanoadamantane (lien article possible?) and 1,2-dicyanobenzene and 1,3-dicyanobenzene (lien article possible?), the PhD subject is focused on the study of radicals in the (sub)millimeter-wave spectral region. To date, the study of 3 radicals was performed up to 900 GHz: methoxy, CH3O and hydroxymethyl, CH2OH (lien article possible?) and cyanomethyl, CH2CN radicals. The team now aims to developped a supersonic expansion (lien vers SPECIES?) to allowed the study of new radicals.
