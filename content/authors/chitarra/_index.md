Dr Olivia Chitarra performed her PhD under the direction of Olivier Pirali and Marie-Aline Martin-Drumel from 2019 to the fall of 2022. During her Master internship (in the same group), she investigated at high resolution several stable molecules: cyanoadamantane and isocyanoadamantane, and 1,2-dicyanobenzene and 1,3-dicyanobenzene. Olivia's PhD subject focused on the study of radicals in the (sub)millimeter-wave spectral region, notably the methoxy (CH<sub>3</sub>O), hydroxymethyl (CH<sub>2</sub>OH), and cyanomethyl (CH<sub>2</sub>CN) radicals. She also participated in the experimental development of a supersonic expansion chamber ([SPECIES project]({{< relref "/project/species" >}})).
