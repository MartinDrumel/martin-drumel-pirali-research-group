bio: My research interests focus on molecular spectroscopy of stable molecules and transient species, and its applications for astrophysics and physical-chemistry. 
#I received a PhD in Physics from the university of Paris-Sud (now Paris-Saclay) in 2012, under the supervision of Prof. Philippe Bréchignac and Dr. Olivier Pirali. I then completed my post-doctoral research in three different groups. From 2012 to 2013 I was appointed in the University of Littoral Côte d’Opale (France), University of Cologne (Germany), where I joined the Group of Prof. Stephan Schlemmer, and at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (USA) with Dr. Michael McCarthy. I was appointed in 2017 to a research position in France at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France).
