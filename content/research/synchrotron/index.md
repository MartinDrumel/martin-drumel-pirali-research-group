Our team exploits the far infrared synchrotron radiation extracted by the AILES beamline of SOLEIL synchrotron to record and to analyze high resolution absorption spectra of gas-phase species. The spectra are recorded at the ultimate resolution of 30 MHz with a Bruker IFS125 Fourier Transform interferometer, allowing the study of rotational structures of various molecular species. Several experimental set-ups have been developed in association with the AILES beamline and the Bruker interferometer to record high resolution spectra of various molecular species. A room temperature long-absorption path length cell allows the study of relatively large C-bearing species, two discharge cells have been installed to record the far-IR spectra of light radicals and ions, and finally a close collaboration with the [Jet-AILES consortium]({{< relref "/project/jet-ailes" >}}) permits to study the spectra of molecular complexes as well as large molecules (containing more than 20 atoms) cooled in a supersonic expansion.

We are also involved in several instrumental developments in particular within the 
[HEROES project]({{< relref "/project/heroes" >}}). Two new spectrometers, relying on the heterodyne mixing of the synchrotron radiation in various modes of operations with a local oscillator (molecular laser), allow to record absorption spectra with a resolution down to few tens of kHz over the whole the far-infrared spectral range.
