Olivia won one of the two Amat-Mills awards at the [27th Colloquium on High-Resolution Molecular Spectroscopy](https://hrms21.scg.ch/). She presented her recent work on the millimeter- and submillimeter-wave spectroscopy of radicals(with special emphasis on CH<sub>2</sub>CN) using two experimental setups: a H-abstraction method coupled with our frequency multiplication chain-based spectrometer ([MACO-GT]({{< relref "/project/macogt" >}}) project) and a supersonic expansion coupled with our chirped-pulse spectrometer ([SPECIES]({{< relref "/project/species" >}}) project).
