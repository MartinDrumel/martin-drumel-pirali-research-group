abstract: "Simple aromatic molecules may be precursors for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in space, and some of the simplest ones are now detected in the earliest stages of star formation [1]. Evidence of benzonitrile (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-CN) in the interstellar medium [2] questions the presence of related aromatic nitriles and their ring-chain derivatives. In light of previous work [3] on phenylpropiolonitrile (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>N), we are investigating, by laboratory high-resolution studies, its ethynylbenzonitrile (HCC-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-CN) derivatives where a -CN and a -CCH groups lie in ortho (2-ETB), meta (3-ETB) or para (4-ETB) positions.

\n
The pure rotational spectrum of these compounds has been recorded at room temperature in the millimeter-wave
domain using a chirped-pulse W-band (75â€“110 GHz) spectrometer. To facilitate spectral assignments, quantum chemical
calculations have been performed using density functional theory at the $\\omega$B97X-D/cc-pVQZ level of theory (geometry optimization, harmonic frequencies).

\n
We will report a description of the experimental set-up and of our assignment procedure.
