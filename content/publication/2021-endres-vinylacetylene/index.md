abstract: "The high resolution vibrational spectrum of vinyl acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>CCH) has been investigated in the far infrared region from 180 to 360 cm$^{-1}$ using the Bruker IFS 120 HR spectrometer at Justus-Liebig-Universität, Gießen, Germany. The two energetically lowest vibrational fundamentals ν<sub>13</sub> and ν<sub>18</sub> at 214 cm$^{-1}$ and 304 cm$^{-1}$ , respectively, were measured at a resolution of 0.0016 cm$^{-1}$ . In addition to the fundamental modes, several hot bands originating from either ν<sub>13</sub> or ν<sub>18</sub> were observed and analyzed. The spectroscopic analysis was supported by high-level quantum chemical coupled-cluster calculations. In addition to the infrared study, so far unpublished millimeter-wave vibrational satellites that were measured in the course of an earlier study of the pure rotational spectrum of vinyl acetylene in its ground vibrational state ([Thorwirth and Lichau, Astron. Astrophys. 398, L11, 2003](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2003/05/aaek204/aaek204.html)) were added to the data set and are reported here for the first time."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We report the rotational and vibrational investigation of two polar derivatives of adamantane (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>), 1-cyanoadamantane (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>--CN) and 1-isocyanoadamantane (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>--NC), providing all necessary information for an active search of these species in space.
