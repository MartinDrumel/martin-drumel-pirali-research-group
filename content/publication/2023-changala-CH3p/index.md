# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We report a comprehensive rovibrational assignments of the 7 µm features of CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, guided by theoretical and experimental laboratory techniques.

abstract: "*Context*: The methyl cation (CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) has recently been discovered in the interstellar medium through the detection of 7 µm (1400 cm<sup>-1</sup>) features toward the d203-506 protoplanetary disk by the JWST. Line-by-line spectroscopic assignments of these features, however, were unsuccessful due to complex intramolecular perturbations preventing a determination of the excitation and abundance of the species in that source. 
*Aims*: Comprehensive rovibrational assignments guided by theoretical and experimental laboratory techniques provide insight into the excitation mechanisms and chemistry of CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> in d203-506. 
*Methods*: The rovibrational structure of CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> was studied theoretically by a combination of coupled-cluster electronic structure theory and (quasi-)variational nuclear motion calculations. Two experimental techniques were used to confirm the rovibrational structure of CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>: 1. Infrared leak-out spectroscopy of the methyl cation: CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> ions, produced by the electron impact dissociative ionization of methane, were injected into a 22-pole ion trap where they were probed by the pulses of infrared radiation from the FELIX free electron laser; 2. Rotationally resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of the methyl radical (CH<sub>3</sub>): Neutral CH<sub>3</sub>, produced by CH<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> pyrolysis in a molecular beam, was probed by pulsed-field ionization zero-kinetic-energy photoelectron spectroscopy. *Results*: The quantum chemical calculations performed in this study have enabled a comprehensive spectroscopic assignment of the ν<sup>+</sup><sub>2</sub> and ν<sup>+</sup><sub>4</sub> bands of CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> detected by the JWST. The resulting spectroscopic constants and derived Einstein A coefficients fully reproduce both the infrared and photoelectron spectra and permit the rotational temperature of CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> (T = 660 ± 80 K) in d203-506 to be derived. A beam-averaged column density of CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> in this protoplanetary disk is also estimated. "
