# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We report a spectroscopic investigation and interstellar searches of norbornadiene and its cyano derivatives.

abstract: "The norbornadiene (NBD) molecule, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, owes its fame to its remarkable photoswitching properties that are promising for molecular solar-thermal energy storage systems. "
