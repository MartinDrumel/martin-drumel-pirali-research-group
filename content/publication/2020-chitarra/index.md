# Abstract
abstract: "The hydroxymethyl radical (CH<sub>2</sub>OH) is one of two structural isomers, together with the methoxy radical (CH<sub>3</sub>O), that can be produced by abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH). In the interstellar medium (ISM), both CH<sub>2</sub>OH and CH<sub>3</sub>O are suspected to be intermediate species in many chemical reactions, including those of formation and destruction of methanol. The determination of the CH<sub>3</sub>O/CH<sub>2</sub>OH ratio in the ISM would bring important information concerning the formation processes of these species in the gas and solid phases. Interestingly, only CH<sub>3</sub>O has been detected in the ISM so far, despite the recent first laboratory measurement of the CH<sub>2</sub>OH rotation-tunneling spectrum. This lack of detection is possibly due to the non-observation in the laboratory of the most intense rotation-tunneling transitions at low temperatures.

Aims. To support further searches for the hydroxymethyl radical in space, we present a thorough spectroscopic study of its rotation-tunneling spectrum, with a particular focus on transitions involving the lowest quantum numbers of the species.
Methods. We recorded the rotation-tunneling spectrum of CH<sub>2</sub>OH at room temperature in the millimeter-wave domain using a frequency multiplication chain spectrometer. A fluorine-induced H-abstraction method from methanol was used to produce the radical.
Results. About 180 transitions were observed, including those involving the lowest N and K a quantum numbers, which are predicted to be intense under cold astrophysical conditions. These transitions were fitted together with available millimeter-wave lines from the literature. A systematic observation of all components of the rotational transitions yields a large improvement of the spectroscopic parameters allowing confident searches of the hydroxymethyl radical in cold to warm environments of the ISM."
