abstract: "The oxygen absorption spectrum in the 50-170 cm<sup>-1</sup> spectral range is studied at the AILES beam line of the SOLEIL synchrotron with a Fourier transform spectrometer equipped with a 151-m multipass gas cell. The spectrum recorded at room temperature (23.15Â°C) with a pressure of 19.76 Torr is formed by weak pure rotational magnetic dipole transitions. Line parameters of 26 lines are derived and compared to literature values. In particular, measured line intensities confirm the 45 years-old previous values reported by Boreiko et al. (*J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer* 32 (1984)109-117). The agreement with HITRAN intensities (within 1% level for the strongest lines) indicates that the 20% HITRAN error estimate was overly cautious: we show that the error is more likely within 2%. "
