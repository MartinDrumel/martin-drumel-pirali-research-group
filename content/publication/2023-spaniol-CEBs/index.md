# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We report a joint experimental and theoretical study of three structural isomers of phenylpropiolonitrile, namely ortho-, meta-, and para-cyanoethynylbenzene.

abstract: "We report the study of three structural isomers of phenylpropiolonitrile (3-phenyl-2-propynenitrile, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>–C<sub>3</sub>N) containing an alkyne function and a cyano group, namely ortho-, meta-, and para-cyanoethynylbenzene (HCC–C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>–CN). The pure rotational spectra of these species have been recorded at room temperature in the millimeter-wave domain using a chirped-pulse spectrometer (75–110 GHz) and a source-frequency modulation spectrometer (140–220 GHz). Assignments of transitions in the vibrational ground state and several vibrationally excited states were supported by quantum chemical calculations using the so-called ''Lego brick'' approach [A. Melli, F. Tonolo, V. Barone and C. Puzzarini, *J. Phys. Chem. A*, 2021, 125, 9904–9916]. From these assignments, accurate spectroscopic (rotational and centrifugal distortion) constants have been derived: for all species and all observed vibrational states, predicted rotational constants show relative accuracy better than 0.1%, and often of the order of 0.01%, compared to the experimental values. The present work hence further validates the use of the ''Lego brick'' approach for predicting spectroscopic constants with high precision. "
