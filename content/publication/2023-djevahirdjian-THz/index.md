# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We report a joint experimental and theoretical study of three structural isomers of phenylpropiolonitrile, namely ortho-, meta-, and para-cyanoethynylbenzene.

abstract: "We present a robust approach to generate a continuously tunable, low phase noise, Hz linewidth and mHz/s stability THz emission in the 0.1 THz to 1.4 THz range. This is achieved by photomixing two commercial telecom, distributed feedback lasers locked by optical-feedback onto a single highly stable V-shaped optical cavity. The phase noise is evaluated up to 1.2 THz, demonstrating Hz-level linewidth. To illustrate the spectral performances and agility of the source, low pressure absorption lines of methanol and water vapors have been recorded up to 1.4 THz. In addition, the hyperfine structure of a water line at 556.9 GHz, obtained by saturation spectroscopy, is also reported, resolving spectral features displaying a full-width at half-maximum of 10 kHz. The present results unambiguously establish the performances of this source for ultra-high resolution molecular physics. "
