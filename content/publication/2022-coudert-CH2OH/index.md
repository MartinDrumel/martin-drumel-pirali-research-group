# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We report on the theoretical and experimental investigation of the CH<sub>2</sub>OH radical pure rotational spectrum in the (sub-)millimeter wave domain.

abstract: "The (sub-)millimeter wave spectrum of the non-rigid CH<sub>2</sub>OH radical is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Ab initio calculations are carried out to quantitatively characterize its potential energy surface as a function of the two large amplitude H<sub>1</sub>COH and H<sub>2</sub>COH dihedral angles. It is shown that the radical displays a large amplitude torsional-like motion of its CH<sub>2</sub> group with respect to the OH group. The rotation-torsion levels computed with the help of a 4D Hamiltonian accounting for this torsional-like motion and for the overall rotation exhibit a tunneling splitting, in agreement with recent experimental investigations, and a strong rotational dependence of this tunneling splitting on the rotational quantum number <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> due to the rotationâ€“torsion Coriolis coupling. Based on an internal axis method approach, a fitting Hamiltonian accounting for tunneling effects and for the fine and hyperfine structure is built and applied to the fitting of the new (sub)-millimeter wave transitions measured in this work along with previously available high-resolution data. 778 frequencies and wavenumbers are reproduced with a unitless standard deviation of 0.79 using 27 parameters. The <i>N</i> = 0 tunneling splitting, which could not be determined unambiguously in the previous high-resolution investigations, is determined based on its rotational dependence.
