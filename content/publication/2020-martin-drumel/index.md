abstract: "The high resolution far-infrared spectrum of $trans$-butadiene has been re-investigated by Fourier-transform spectroscopy at two synchrotron radiation facilities, SOLEIL and the Canadian Light Source, at temperatures ranging from 50 to 340 K. Beyond the well-studied bands, two new fundamental bands lying below 1100 cm$^{-1}$, ν<sub>10</sub> and ν<sub>24</sub>, have been assigned using a combination of cross-correlation (ASAP software) and Loomis-Wood type (LWWa software) diagrams. While the ν<sub>24</sub> analysis was rather straightforward, ν<sub>10</sub> exhibits obvious signs of a strong perturbation, presumably owing to interaction with the dark $v$<sub>9</sub>+$v$<sub>12</sub> state. Effective rotational constants have been derived for both the $$v_{10}=1$$ and $$v_{24}=1$$ states. 
Since only one weak, infrared active fundamental band (ν<sub>23</sub>) of $trans$-butadiene remains to be observed at high resolution in the far-infrared, searches for the elusive $gauche$ conformer can now be undertaken with considerably greater confidence in the dense ro-vibrational spectrum of the $trans$ form.
