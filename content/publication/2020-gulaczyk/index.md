abstract: "For the first time the $\\nu_4$ NH<sub>2</sub> scissors band has been assigned in a high-resolution infrared spectrum. A rotationally resolved spectrum of methylamine was recorded using two infrared spectroscopic techniques. A White-type multi-pass cell device coupled to the Bruker IFS 125 HR Fourier transform spectrometer was implemented on the AILES beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility and a room-temperature spectrum of the whole band in the region of 1540-1710 cm<sup>-1</sup> was recorded with a resolution of 0.001 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Then, a low-temperature high-resolution spectrum in the 1622.5-1655.6 cm<sup>-1</sup> range of Q and R branches of the $\\nu_4$ band was recorded using a quantum cascade laser spectrometer. Preliminary assignment was carried out in the NH<sub>2</sub> scissors band region, and about 2200 transitions for $K$ from 0 to 6 have been assigned for A, B, and E<sub>1</sub> symmetry species. The simultaneous fit of assigned lines using a group-theoretical effective Hamiltonian was not successful; instead simple polynomial series expansions were used for each symmetry and $K$ value."
