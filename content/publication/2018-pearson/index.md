abstract: "The infrared spectrum of ammonia has proven to be highly problematic for effective Hamiltonian analysis. The most complete previous study of the 3$\\nu_2$ and $\\nu_4+\\nu_2$ bands achieved the accuracy of 0.0069 cm<sup>-1</sup> as reflected by the root-mean-square error of their fit, which is slightly more than 10 times the experimental accuracy. In the present study, we performed a global fit of the existing 2141 literature data involving $3\\nu_2$, $\\nu_4+\\nu_2$, $3\\nu_2-\\nu_2$ , $(\\nu_4+\\nu_2)-\\nu_2$ together with 1281 new data involving $3\\nu_2-2\\nu_2$, $3\\nu_2-3\\nu_2$ and $(\\nu_4+\\nu_2)-(\\nu_4+\\nu_2)$ using an effective Hamiltonian together with the Pickett suite of program SPFIT/SPCAT. The new dataset consists of three spectra recorded at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. The effective Hamiltonian model proposed for $3\\nu_2/\\nu_4+\\nu_2$ has achieved experimental accuracy. This success combined with our previous success of the $2\\nu_2/\\nu_4$ analysis leads us to believe that the vibrational states higher than $3\\nu_2/\\nu_2+\\nu_4$ may be analyzed with effective Hamiltonians as well."
