 abstract = {The infrared spectrum of ammonia has proven to be highly problematic for effective Hamiltonian analysis. The most complete previous study of the 3v(2) and v(4)+v(2) bands achieved the accuracy of 0.0069 cm(-1) as reflected by the root-mean-square error of their fit, which is slightly more than 10 times the experimental accuracy. In the present study, we performed a global fit of the existing 2141 literature data involving 3v(2), v(4)+v(2), 3v(2)-v(2) , (v(4)+v(2))-v(2) together with 1281 new data involving 3v(2)-2v(2), 3v(2)-3v(2) and (v(4)+v(2) )-(v(4)+v(2) ) using an effective Hamiltonian together with the Pickett suite of program SPFIT/SPCAT. The new dataset consists of three spectra recorded at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. The effective Hamiltonian model proposed for 3v(2)/v(4)+v(2) has achieved experimental accuracy. This success combined with our previous success of the 2v(2)/v(4) analysis leads us to believe that the vibrational states higher than 3v(2)/v(2)+v(4) may be analyzed with effective Hamiltonians as well.
