# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We propose a new figure of merit, the molecular gain factor, that allows to discriminate transitions accessible by QCL-pumped THz gas lasers according to their lasing potential.

abstract: "Quantum cascade laser-pumped terahertz (THz) gas lasers are at the edge of revolutionizing THz science where powerful yet tunable sources have long been lacking. Maybe one of the last remaining drawbacks to a wider use of these instruments lies in the lack of available databases of potentially lasing transitions for users. A new figure of merit, the molecular gain factor is proposed, that allows to discriminate transitions by their lasing potential. Using this factor, catalogs of THz laser lines of ammonia, both <sup>14</sup>NH<sub>3</sub> and <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>3</sub>, up to 10 THz are reported. Demonstration of the use of these two catalogs, and of the pertinence of the molecular gain factor, is made by experimentally observing 32 laser lines of <sup>14</sup>NH<sub>3</sub> and 5 lines of <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>3</sub> up to 5.5 THz. Prospects to generalize the use of this molecular gain factor to a wide range of molecules are discussed."
