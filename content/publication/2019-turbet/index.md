abstract: "We present an experimental study of the absorption, between 40 and 640 cm<sup>-1</sup>, by CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> gases as well as by H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> mixtures at room temperature. A Fourier transform spectrometer associated to a multi-pass cell, whose optics were adjusted to obtain a 152 m path length, were used to record transmission spectra at total pressures up to about 0.98 bar. These measurements provide information concerning the collision-induced absorption (CIA) bands as well as about the wing of the CO<sub>2</sub> 15 &mu;m band. Our results for the CIAs of pure gases are, within uncertainties, in agreement with previous determinations, validating our experimental and data analysis procedures. We then consider the CIAs by H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> and the low frequency wing of the pure CO<sub>2</sub> 15 &mu;m band, for which there are, to our knowledge, no previous measurements. We confirm experimentally the theoretical prediction of Wordsworth et al. (2017) that the H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> CIAs are significantly stronger in the 50-550 cm<sup>-1</sup> region than those of H<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>, respectively. However, we find that the shape and the strength of these recorded CIAs differ from the aforementioned predictions. For the pure CO<sub>2</sub> line-wings, we show that both the $\chi$-factor deduced from measurements near 4 &mu;m and a line-mixing model very well describe the observed strongly sub-Lorentzian behavior in the 500-600 cm<sup>-1</sup> region. These experimental results open renewed perspectives for studies of the past climate of Mars and extrasolar analogues."
