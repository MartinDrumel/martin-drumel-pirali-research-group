Our knowledge of the chemical composition of various objects in the interstellar medium is based on spectroscopic observations. In particular, laboratory spectroscopy obtained at high spectral resolution and allowing the precise characterization of the rotational levels of given molecular species has enabled the detection (or confirmation of detection) of more than 200 molecules in the interstellar medium to date. Interstellar spectra currently recorded using instruments such ALMA contain many transitions which remain unassigned mainly because the molecules at the origin of these transitions have not been studied in the laboratory to date.
We investigate in the laboratory various species, both stable and reactive, of astrophysical interest.
