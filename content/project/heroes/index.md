The goal of the project “HEROES” is to provide to the national and international scientific community two ultra-high resolution spectrometers operating in the THz (0.1 THz-1.1 THz) and far-IR (1 THz-6 THz) spectral regions by exploiting the heterodyne techniques. These instruments are under development on the AILES beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron facility.
The project results from a consortium of four different laboratories having very complementary skills ISMO (UMR 8214 – U-PSUD), IEMN (UMR 8520 – U-Lille), LPCA (EA 4493- ULCO), la ligne AILES (SOLEIL Saclay). 

While in the IR several light sources and spectrometers are highly performant, THz technologies still suffer from either limited power or narrow bandwidth despite the large technological advances realized in the last years (e.g. opto-electronic conversion, quantum cascade lasers, multiplication chains pumped by microwave synthesizers, …). 
Over the last 15 years, the AILES beamline made important efforts to optimize the performances of the THz and far-IR radiation extracted at SOLEIL. As every synchrotron-based far-IR spectroscopy stations over the world, the AILES beamline makes use of Fourier transform interferometry to acquire high resolution absorption spectra. Due to the limited optical delay line obtained using mechanical displacement of the moving mirror, such technique has inherent limited spectral resolution (30 MHz is the highest spectral resolution available using commercial interefrometers). 


The first spectrometer is based on the exploitation of QCLs-pumped THz molecular lasers used as local oscillators (LO) in a heterodyne receiver collecting the far-IR synchrotron continuum. The huge number of far-IR laser emission lines of the LO (available from such optical excitation), and the coupling with the bright far-IR continuum source permits a full frequency coverage in the 1-5 THz spectral range with unprecedented resolution (better than 1 MHz). This original approach will open new, broad perspectives for high resolution molecular spectroscopy in terms of size of the molecular families to be studied, observation of fine coupling between angular momenta, energy levels splittings due to large amplitude motions…

The second realization follows the recent discovery of the discrete nature of the CSR in various operation modes. We demonstrated that CSR is emitted through a very stable THz frequency comb (FC) with 846 kHz spacing between comb teeth. Thanks to this very interesting spectral characteristic, we are developing a dual-comb spectrometer by probing the CSR-FC with a second FC having a repetition rate close to 846 kHz. This leads to detect the beating between the two FCs in the radiofrequency domain where electronic devices are extremely performant. This new THz spectrometer combines high brilliance and spectral coverage from CSR with the high resolution and ultra-fast spectral analysis of the dual-comb approach which revolutionized molecular spectroscopy in the mid- and near-IR regions.
