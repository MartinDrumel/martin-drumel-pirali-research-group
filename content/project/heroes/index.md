The goal of our project “HEROES” is to provide to the national and international scientific community two ultra-high resolution spectrometers in the THz (0.1 THz-1.1 THz) and far-IR (1 THz-6 THz) spectral regions using the heterodyne techniques. These instruments will be set-up on the AILES beamline of SOLEIL facility.

The AILES beamline extracts synchrotron radiation emitted by various operating modes of the SOLEIL machine in a broad spectral range covering the THz and far-IR regions. The AILES beamline aims at characterizing the spectral properties of various materials and molecular species using the synchrotron radiation. While in the IR several light sources and spectrometers are highly performant, THz technologies still suffer of either limited power, or low spectral purity or narrow bandwidth despite the large technological advances realized in the last years (e.g. opto-electronic conversion, quantum cascade lasers, multiplication chains pumped by microwave synthesizers, …). Since ten years the AILES team made important efforts to optimize the performances of the THz and far-IR radiation extracted by the beamline. As every synchrotron-based far-IR spectroscopy stations over the world, the AILES beamline makes use of Fourier transform interferometry to acquire high resolution absorption spectra. Due to the limited optical delay line obtained using mechanical displacement of the moving mirror, such technique has inherent limited spectral resolution (30 MHz is the highest spectral resolution available from commercial interefrometers). Since its opening, AILES beamline had a federative role in the scientific community leading to the creation of several consortia dedicated to instrumental developments and specific spectroscopic applications. The present project is a consortium of four different laboratories having very complementary skills ISMO (UMR 8214 – U-PSUD), IEMN (UMR 8520 – U-Lille), LPCA (EA 4493- ULCO), la ligne AILES (SOLEIL Saclay). Our consortium relies on two recent discoveries: the implementation on QCL-based new molecular far-IR lasers on one side and the dense THz frequency comb (FC) emitted by the Coherent Synchrotron Radiations (CSR) operating modes.
