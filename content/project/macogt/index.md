The MACO-GT (*Molécules Astrophysiques à COuche ouverte et de Grande Taille*) project is part of a long-term collaboration with astrophysicists and concerns the laboratory spectroscopy of large radicals. Among all the molecules detected in the interstellar medium, very few radical species containing more than 5 atoms have been identified. This lack of detection is due to the lack of high-resolution laboratory spectroscopic data for these species. Thanks to a technique for producing radicals based on the reaction between a parent molecule and atomic fluorine, we propose to record their spectra at high resolution, from the millimeter-wave to the infrared region, and to develop theoretical approaches for their modeling. 


This project is supported by a public grant from the *Laboratoire d'Excellence Physics Atoms Light Mater* ([LabEx PALM](https://www.labex-palm.fr/)) overseen by the French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the *Investissements d'Avenir* program (ANR-10-LABX-0039-PALM).
